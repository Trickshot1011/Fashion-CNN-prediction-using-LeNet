Here I have implemented, Lenet model using pytorch. I have used torchvision to import the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

The following link will provide you an idea about, Fashion-MNIST:

Pytorch's dataloader package has been used for dataset segregation. You could directly do this without dataloader.
For this, I have used:
  1. CrossEntropy function as loss function
  2. Adam Optimizer
